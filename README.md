Sketch-based authentication system based on existing keystroke authentication tools.

## Motivation

Problem: Online Authentication continues to increase in difficulty with improvements in computing power and global digitilization. Existing strategies for authentication are flawed.

| Idea | Issue | cop or drop |
| Written Passwords | Writing down passwords risks would-be attackers getting their hands on critical information. Physical copies are also easy to misplace. | ❌ |
| Good-ole fashioned memory | Remembering so many passwords is difficult for the average person, it results in password repition or simpler patterns and that's no good. | ❌ |
| Password Managers | Secure password managers are good but they require their own authentication and put all your eggs in one basket. Better, but still not great. | ❌ |
| Biometrics | Biometrics avoid memory-related challenges but they raise privacy concerns, oftern rely on added system requirements, and raise software issues. | ❌ |
| Continuous authentication | Effective but cumbersome and disruptive to workflow. | ❌ |
| Weird ones like "walk-this-way" or unconvential bio-auth | Spacial and time-based difficulties + these techniques have trouble being taken seriously. | ❌ |

## Authentication based on creativity

What is the one thing that can't be copied or stolen from someone? Their creativity. Our minds and bodies change over time but our creative efforts provide a subjective-signature that requires no memorization or additional technology because its innate to us. Sketch is based on the idea that people all think differently and that the way we think is the hardest thing to copy. I've always been entertained by the concept of solipsism and this conclusion follows from the same premise.
